## Local Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values.
2. Configure AWS credentials locally:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.aws
   # edit ~/.aws/credentials
   [everybite-admin]
   aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
   aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
   region = us-west-1
   ```
   Then load the profile when running local dev:
   ```bash
   export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1
   export AWS_PROFILE=everybite-admin
   vercel dev
   ```

3. **Project linking**: The `.vercel` directory (which stores the Vercel project/org IDs) is committed to the repo. After cloning, running `vercel dev` should start immediately. If you ever see the interactive "Set up and develop..." prompt, make sure you're in the project root and that the `.vercel` folder is present. If it was removed, recreate it with `vercel link`.
