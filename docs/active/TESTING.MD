# Testing Strategy

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Purpose**: Test individual components/functions in isolation
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Coverage Goal**: 80%+
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/unit/`

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Purpose**: Test component interactions
- **Tools**: React Testing Library
- **Coverage Goal**: 70%+
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/integration/`

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- **Purpose**: Test complete user flows
- **Tools**: Cypress
- **Coverage Goal**: Critical paths only
- **Location**: `cypress/e2e/`

### 4. Performance Testing

- **Purpose**: Ensure application performance
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, Web Vitals
- **Metrics**: FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.5s

## Running Tests

### All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Unit Tests Only

```bash
npm test:unit
```

### E2E Tests

```bash
# Parallel execution (recommended for performance)
npm run test:e2e:parallel

# Fast parallel execution (6 threads)
npm run test:e2e:parallel:fast

# Sequential execution (for debugging only)
npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Data Management

- Use factory functions for test data
- Reset state between tests
- Mock external services

## Testing Best Practices

1. Test behavior, not implementation
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
4. Keep tests independent
5. Avoid testing implementation details

## Code Coverage

- Minimum coverage: 80%
- Critical paths: 100%
- Ignore generated/boilerplate code

## Continuous Integration

- Runs on every push/PR
- Required to pass before merge
- Reports coverage to CI dashboard

## Visual Regression Testing

- Tools: Storybook + Chromatic
- Run on component updates
- Manual review for UI changes

## Accessibility Testing

- Tools: axe, pa11y
- Run as part of CI pipeline
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance goal

## Performance Budget

- Max bundle size: 200KB gzipped
- Max API response time: 500ms
- Max page load: 3s on 3G

## Test Maintenance

- Review test failures immediately
- Update tests with new features
- Remove obsolete tests
- Document test patterns

## Parallel Execution Performance

### E2E Test Performance

- **Sequential execution**: ~51 seconds (baseline)
- **4 threads**: ~25 seconds (51% faster)
- **6 threads**: ~24 seconds (53% faster)
- **CPU utilization**: 243-307% (efficient parallelization)

### When to Use Parallel vs Sequential

- **Use parallel execution** for:
  - Full test suite runs
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Performance testing
  - Regular development workflow
- **Use sequential execution** for:
  - Debugging individual tests
  - Troubleshooting test failures
  - Development of new tests
