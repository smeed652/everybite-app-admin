# PROJECT ROADMAP

This roadmap communicates the high-level phases, milestones, and sprint goals for the SmartMenu Admin Panel.  It is **public-facing** and should be kept concise.  The internal `plan.md` remains our tactical sprint board.

---

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Goal | Target Domain | Status |
|-------|------|---------------|--------|
| 1.0   | Project setup, CI/CD scaffold, code-gen, baseline docs | – | ✅ complete |
| 1.1   | MVP for Customer Success: auth, dashboard, SmartMenu list/detail editor | `everybite-stage.com` → `everybite.com` | 🚧 current |
| 1.2   | Role-based access, collaboration tools | staging | ⏳ queued |
| 2.x   | Advanced analytics, notifications, mobile optimisations | staging/prod | 🔮 future |

---

## Current Phase — 1.1 MVP

### Objectives
1. Secure login & JWT storage
2. Dashboard shell with key metrics
3. SmartMenu list page (table) & detail editor
4. Audit log view (read-only)
5. Responsive design & accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
6. Unit + integration tests ≥ 80 % coverage

### Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] React + Vite + TS scaffold ✔️
- [ ] Tailwind & shadcn/ui setup ✔️
- [ ] Apollo Client configured with generated hooks ✔️
- [ ] Global ErrorBoundary & toast feedback
- [ ] Service layer (`src/services/`) abstraction
- [ ] Auth pages (login → dashboard redirect)
- [ ] Basic user management (invite, enable/disable, reset password, delete)
  - Implemented minimal UI; full shadcn DataTable + DropdownMenu deferred to future sprint
- [ ] SmartMenu list (query) + detail (mutation)
- [ ] Env-controlled logger (`VITE_LOG_LEVEL`)
- [ ] Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Dockerfile & `docker-compose.yml` for local parity
- [ ] CI pipeline → AWS ( stage / prod )
- [ ] E2E smoke tests in staging

### Configuration
All runtime secrets live only in `.env.local` (never committed). The sample `.env.example` lists every key a developer must set.

| Env Key | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| VITE_GRAPHQL_URI | SmartMenu GraphQL endpoint | `https://api.everybite.com/graphql` |
| VITE_AWS_REGION | AWS region used by Cognito | `us-west-1` |
| VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID | Cognito User-Pool id | `us-west-1_XXXXXXX` |
| VITE_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID | Cognito App-client id (no secret) | `abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234` |
| EVERYBITE_API_KEY | Service key for EveryBite API | `sk_...` |
| VITE_LOG_LEVEL | Browser log level | `info` |

### Timeline (single dev)
| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Scaffold repo, logger, error boundary, husky, Docker |
| 2 | Auth flow & dashboard shell |
| 3 | SmartMenu list + editor, tests |
| 4 | Polish, accessibility audit, deploy to staging |
| 5 | Bug-fixes, deploy to prod |

> Dates are indicative; adjust as work progresses.

## Phase 1.2 Preview
• Role-based permissions (Admin, CS, Marketing)  
• Collaboration tools (comments, file sharing)  
• Notifications service (email + in-app)

---

## Process & Governance
• **Branching**: `main` (prod), `develop` (integrations), feature branches → squash merge.  
• **CI Checks**: lint, tests, build, Docker image, deploy to staging on merge to `develop`.  
• **Release**: manual promote `develop` → `main` (prod) once smoke tests pass.
