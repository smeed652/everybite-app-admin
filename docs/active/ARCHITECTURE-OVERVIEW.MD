# System Architecture

## High-Level Overview
[Diagram or description of the system architecture]

## Components

### Abstraction Layers
- **Service Layer**: All GraphQL and REST calls are concentrated in a typed service layer (`client/src/services/`). UI never calls the network directly; it consumes the service functions, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and easing future backend changes.


### Frontend
- **Structure**: Component hierarchy and organization
- **State Management**: How state is managed across the application
- **Routing**: Navigation and routing approach

### Backend
- **API Layer**: REST/GraphQL endpoints
- **Services**: Business logic organization
- **Data Access**: Database interaction patterns

### Data Flow
1. [Describe how data moves through the system]
2. [Key data transformations]
3. [Caching strategies]

## Security
- Authentication flow
- Authorization rules
- Data protection measures

## Performance Considerations
- Frontend optimizations
- Backend optimizations
- Database indexing and query optimization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services, hooks, and components (Jest + RTL).
- Integration tests for service/UI interactions.
- E2E tests of critical flows in staging (Cypress).
- Coverage thresholds enforced in CI.

## Scaling
- Horizontal/Vertical scaling approach
- Load balancing strategy
- Database sharding/replication if applicable

## Dependencies
- Third-party services
- External APIs
- Libraries and frameworks

## Monitoring and Logging
- Logging is handled via a lightweight wrapper that respects the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (server) or `VITE_LOG_LEVEL` (client) allowing runtime control without redeploying.
- Error tracking with Sentry (placeholder) and console fallbacks in development.
- Performance monitoring via AWS CloudWatch and Web Vitals reports.
- Audit logging for security-related events.
