# Phase 6: Cache Management System - Advanced Features

## üìã Overview

- **Project**: Cache Management System
- **Sprint**: Sprint 9 - Cache Management & UI Enhancement
- **Phase**: 6
- **Status**: Future
- **Start Date**: TBD
- **Target End Date**: TBD
- **Actual End Date**: TBD

## üéØ Goals & Objectives

- [ ] Implement scheduled cache refresh functionality
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running cache operations
- [ ] Optimize cache performance and memory usage
- [ ] Complete comprehensive testing of cache system
- [ ] Document cache management best practices

## üìù Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Scheduled Cache Refresh Implementation

- [ ] Design AWS Lambda + EventBridge architecture for scheduled refresh
- [ ] Create Lambda function for cache refresh operations
- [ ] Implement EventBridge rules for different refresh schedules
- [ ] Add cache refresh status tracking in UI
- [ ] Test scheduled refresh functionality end-to-end

### Step 2: Progress Indicators & UX Enhancements

- [ ] Add progress bars for long-running cache operations
- [ ] Implement loading states for cache refresh/clear operations
- [ ] Add cancel options for in-progress operations
- [ ] Create toast notifications for operation completion
- [ ] Optimize UI responsiveness during cache operations

### Step 3: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement cache hit/miss analytics
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Optimize cache key generation and storage
- [ ] Implement cache size limits and cleanup
- [ ] Add performance metrics dashboard

### Step 4: Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for all cache utilities
- [ ] Create integration tests for cache operations
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for cache management UI
- [ ] Test cache behavior under high load
- [ ] Validate cache persistence across sessions

### Step 5: Documentation & Best Practices

- [ ] Document cache configuration options
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for cache issues
- [ ] Write performance optimization guidelines
- [ ] Update development style guide with caching patterns
- [ ] Create cache management runbook

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] Scheduled cache refresh works reliably via AWS Lambda
- [ ] Progress indicators provide clear feedback for all operations
- [ ] Cache performance meets or exceeds baseline metrics
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 90% for cache-related code
- [ ] Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## üîó Dependencies

- [ ] AWS Lambda and EventBridge access
- [ ] Existing cache management UI (Phase 3 completed)
- [ ] Apollo Client configuration (Phase 2 completed)
- [ ] Testing infrastructure setup

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **Week 1**: Steps 1-2 (Scheduled refresh + Progress indicators)
- **Week 2**: Steps 3-5 (Performance + Testing + Documentation)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AWS Lambda/EventBridge integration complexity
- **Medium Risk**: Performance optimization impact on existing functionality
- **Low Risk**: Documentation and testing tasks

## üìä Progress Tracking

- **Tasks Completed**: 0/15
- **Progress**: 0%
- **Status**: Future
- **Note**: Deferred until Phase 5 (Data Processing Foundation) is completed

## üîó References

- **Sprint**: `docs/sprints/2025-08-11_sprint-9.md`
- **Project**: `docs/projects/cache-management.md`
- **Previous Phase**: `docs/phases/completed/PHASE-3-CACHE-UI.md`
- **Code**: `src/components/cache/`, `src/lib/cacheUtils.ts`, `src/config/cache-config.ts`
- **TODO**: `TODO.md` (Cache Management section)

## üìù Notes

- **FUTURE**: This phase is deferred until Phase 5 (Data Processing Foundation) is completed
- This phase builds on the solid foundation established in Phases 1-4
- Focus on user experience improvements and operational reliability
- Consider implementing cache analytics as a stretch goal
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing cache configurations
- **Priority**: Core functionality must work before implementing advanced features
