  - [x] Implemented cache metadata display (TTL, size, last updated)
  - [x] Added formatted data display with JSON/tables
  - [x] Included cache health indicators (expired, stale, fresh)
  - [x] Added export functionality for cache data

- [x] **Cache Operations Integration**:
  - [x] Updated `CacheOperationsList` to include view buttons
  - [x] Integrated cache contents viewer into `CacheManagement` page
  - [x] Added state management for selected cache operations
  - [x] Fixed cache reading logic to use localStorage properly

### Step 3: Comprehensive Testing Implementation ‚úÖ

- [x] **Mock Data Creation**:
  - [x] Created mock data files for all Lambda queries:
    - `src/mocks/lambda/dashboardMetrics.json`
    - `src/mocks/lambda/featureAdoption.json`
    - `src/mocks/lambda/quarterlyTrends.json`
    - `src/mocks/lambda/monthlyGrowth.json`
    - `src/mocks/lambda/dailyOrdersTrends.json`
    - `src/mocks/lambda/activationInsights.json`
    - `src/mocks/lambda/retentionAnalytics.json`
  - [x] Used real Lambda output for accurate mock data
  - [x] Updated mock handlers to match Lambda response structure

- [x] **API Smoke Testing**:
  - [x] Created `src/__tests__/api/lambda-graphql.smoke.test.ts`
  - [x] Tested all 7 Lambda queries against deployed endpoint
  - [x] Verified response structure matches expected schema
  - [x] Tested error handling and API key authentication
  - [x] Added Lambda tests to CI pipeline

- [x] **Integration Testing**:
  - [x] Updated existing smoke tests to include Lambda queries
  - [x] Created integration tests for dashboard components
  - [x] Verified metrics display correctly with Lambda data
  - [x] Tested error states and loading states

### Step 4: Data Processing Pattern Architecture ‚úÖ

- [x] **Documentation Structure**:
  - [x] Created `docs/architecture/data-processing-pattern.md`
  - [x] Created `docs/architecture/README.md` for maintenance guidelines
  - [x] Updated main `docs/README.md` with architecture section
  - [x] Established comprehensive architectural documentation

- [x] **Pattern Implementation**:
  - [x] Defined service layer pattern for data processing
  - [x] Created hook patterns for data fetching
  - [x] Established component patterns for UI presentation
  - [x] Documented file structure and organization guidelines

- [x] **Architecture Guidelines**:
  - [x] Defined when and how to update documentation
  - [x] Created review process for documentation changes
  - [x] Established version control and maintenance procedures
  - [x] Provided templates and examples for consistency

### Step 5: Frontend Integration ‚úÖ

- [x] **Dashboard Integration**:
  - [x] Updated `Dashboard.tsx` to use Lambda hooks
  - [x] Integrated `useDashboardLambda` and `useQuarterlyMetricsLambda`
  - [x] Updated `PlayerAnalyticsSection` to use Lambda data
  - [x] Verified metrics display correctly with real data

- [x] **Hook Implementation**:
  - [x] Created Lambda-specific hooks in `src/features/dashboard/hooks/lambda/`
  - [x] Implemented proper error handling and loading states
