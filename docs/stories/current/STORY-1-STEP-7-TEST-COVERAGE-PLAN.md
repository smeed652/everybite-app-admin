# Step 7: Test Coverage Expansion Plan - Story 1

## Goal

Achieve 100% test coverage for all custom hooks, service layer files, utilities, caching logic, and all major app directories in the codebase.

---

## Current Focus: Hooks Coverage (Phase 1)

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ In Progress  
**Current Task:** Creating comprehensive test files for all hooks in `src/hooks/`

- [x] useDataService.ts _(removed as unused â€” no references found in codebase)_
- [x] useDataWarehouse*Lambda.ts *(test file created with comprehensive coverage)\_
- [x] useTableSort.ts _(test file created with comprehensive coverage)_

### Next Steps

1. Move to Phase 6: Types testing
2. Continue systematic approach through remaining core system phases
3. Review and validate all test coverage
4. Prepare for UI/Component testing after design refactor

### TODO - Test File Refactoring

- Review all test files created during this sprint for size and complexity
- Consider refactoring large test files into smaller, more focused test suites
- Evaluate if some test files could be simplified while maintaining good coverage
- Document patterns for optimal test file size and structure
- Specific files to review: useSmartMenuSettingsHybrid.test.ts, useServiceGroupOperations.test.ts

## Notes

- **Approach**: Systematic phase-by-phase coverage to ensure quality and maintainability
- **Quality Standards**: Each test file must cover all logic branches, edge cases, and state transitions
- **Documentation**: All findings, edge cases, and potential refactors are documented here
- **Code Quality**: Tests are written to be maintainable and provide clear failure messages
- **Performance**: All tests use proper mocking to ensure fast execution and isolation
- **Coverage Goal**: 100% coverage for each file before moving to the next
- **Story Integration**: This plan is part of Story 1: Test Suite Restoration & Quality Assurance (Sprint 11)
