# Out-of-Scope Tasks - Story 1: Business Logic Foundation

## Purpose

This file tracks tasks that are outside the current story scope but need attention. These will be discussed at the end of each step and can be addressed if they become critical or if time permits.

## Story Information

- **Story**: Story 1 - Business Logic Foundation
- **Sprint**: Sprint 12 - Business Logic Architecture & Testing Strategy
- **Start Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Current Step**: Step 1 - Directory Structure and Patterns

## Story Scope Boundaries

### **What IS In Scope:**

- Creating `src/business-logic/` directory structure
- Defining business logic patterns and conventions
- Creating shared types and interfaces for business logic
- Enhancing existing quarterly metrics business logic
- Documenting architecture decisions

### **What is NOT In Scope (Out-of-Scope):**

#### **UI/Component Changes:**

- [ ] **UI Component Refactoring**: Any changes to UI components beyond importing business logic
- [ ] **Component Testing**: Writing tests for UI components
- [ ] **UI Design Changes**: Any visual or design modifications
- [ ] **Component Architecture**: Changes to component structure or patterns

#### **Dashboard Logic Extraction:**

- [ ] **Dashboard Calculations**: Extracting dashboard logic from UI components (Story 2)
- [ ] **Dashboard Integration**: Integrating dashboard business logic with hooks (Story 2)
- [ ] **Dashboard Testing**: Testing dashboard business logic (Story 2)

#### **Testing Strategy Implementation:**

- [ ] **Contract Testing**: Implementing service layer contract tests (Story 3)
- [ ] **Test Migration**: Migrating existing tests to new strategy (Story 3)
- [ ] **Test Documentation**: Updating test templates and documentation (Story 3)

#### **Advanced Features:**

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Any performance improvements beyond basic structure
- [ ] **Advanced Caching**: Complex caching strategies or optimizations
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Complex analytics or reporting features
- [ ] **Advanced Validation**: Complex validation schemas or rules

#### **Infrastructure Changes:**

- [ ] **Build System Changes**: Modifications to build configuration
- [ ] **Deployment Changes**: Changes to deployment processes
- [ ] **CI/CD Changes**: Modifications to CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] **Environment Changes**: Changes to environment configuration

## Step 1 - Directory Structure and Patterns

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

_No out-of-scope tasks encountered yet_

### Notes:

- Focus on creating the foundation structure only
- Don't implement complex business logic beyond basic patterns
- Don't start on dashboard or testing work
- Keep it simple and focused on the foundation

## Step 2 - Quarterly Metrics Enhancement

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

_No out-of-scope tasks encountered yet_

### Notes:

- Only enhance existing quarterly metrics business logic
- Don't create new analytics features
- Don't modify the Lambda backend
- Don't change the data structure beyond what's needed for the foundation

## Step 3 - Business Logic Types

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

_No out-of-scope tasks encountered yet_

### Notes:

- Create shared types for business logic foundation only
- Don't create types for specific features (dashboard, etc.)
- Don't create complex validation schemas
- Keep types simple and focused on the foundation

## Step 4 - Architecture Documentation

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

_No out-of-scope tasks encountered yet_

### Notes:

- Document only the foundation architecture decisions
- Don't document future features or implementations
- Don't create detailed implementation guides
- Focus on patterns and conventions for the foundation

## Common Out-of-Scope Patterns

### **If You Encounter These, They're Out-of-Scope:**

1. **"While we're here..."** - Any work that's not directly related to the foundation
2. **"This would be better if..."** - Improvements that aren't part of the foundation
3. **"We should also..."** - Additional features or enhancements
4. **"Let's fix this too..."** - Bug fixes or improvements not related to foundation
5. **"This reminds me..."** - Related work that belongs in other stories

### **How to Handle Out-of-Scope Tasks:**

1. **Document them here** with impact and effort estimate
2. **Don't implement them** unless they become blocking
3. **Add to deferred work backlog** if they're important
4. **Create separate stories** for high-priority items
5. **Reassess scope** only if they become critical blockers

## Scope Creep Prevention

### **Questions to Ask Before Adding Work:**

1. **Is this directly related to the business logic foundation?**
2. **Is this required for Story 1 to be complete?**
3. **Can this wait until a future story?**
4. **Is this a blocking issue or a nice-to-have?**
5. **Does this fit within the 7 story points allocated?**

### **Red Flags (Stop and Reassess):**

- Work that would take more than 1 day
- Work that involves other stories' scope
- Work that requires significant changes to existing code
- Work that involves UI components or testing
- Work that's not documented in the story scope
