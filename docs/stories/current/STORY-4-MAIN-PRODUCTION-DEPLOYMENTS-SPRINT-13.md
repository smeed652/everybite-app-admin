## 🔧 Technical Approach

### **Deployment Strategy**

1. **Staged Deployment**: Deploy to Main first, then Production
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Test all features and functionality
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Set up proper monitoring and alerting
4. **Rollback Preparation**: Ensure rollback procedures are ready

### **Validation Strategy**

1. **Functional Testing**: Test all application features
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance metrics
3. **Integration Testing**: Test all integrations and APIs
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate user workflows

### **Monitoring Strategy**

1. **Application Monitoring**: Monitor application health and performance
2. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Monitor infrastructure and resources
3. **Error Monitoring**: Monitor errors and exceptions
4. **Alerting Setup**: Set up proper alerting for issues
