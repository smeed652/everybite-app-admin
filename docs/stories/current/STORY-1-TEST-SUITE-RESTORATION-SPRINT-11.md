- **Test Analysis**: Based on current test run results

## 📝 Notes

- **Architecture Changes**: Phase 5 introduced significant architecture changes that broke existing tests
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Lambda GraphQL endpoint returning 502 Bad Gateway errors for most queries - this is a real infrastructure problem, not a test issue
- **Test Progress**: Dashboard tests fixed and passing, SmartMenu tests partially fixed, UI tests mostly passing
- **API Test Findings**: SmartMenu settings tests working (3/3 passing), hybrid service tests partially working (4/5 passing)
- **Authentication Issues**: Test environment missing proper auth headers for some API tests
- **Step 2 Completion**: API integration fixes completed with infrastructure issues identified
- **Next Steps**: Move to Step 3 (Test Infrastructure & Quality) while infrastructure issues are addressed separately
- **Service Layer**: Tests need to be updated to use new service layer instead of direct Apollo mocks
- **Hybrid Service**: Dashboard tests need to be updated for new hybrid service data structure
- **GraphQL Schema**: SmartMenu tests need schema updates for current GraphQL schema
- **Test Strategy**: Hybrid approach - fix existing tests rather than complete rewrite
- **Priority Order**: Critical fixes first, then API integration, then infrastructure improvements
- **Integration Test Policy:** The integration test that hits the real production API is only run after deployment to staging/production, never during local or CI runs. This ensures no side effects or rate limiting during development.

### 🐛 Critical Bug-Fixing Workflow Discovery

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE DISCOVERED**: When tests pass but bugs exist in production, we MUST fix the tests first to catch the issue, then fix the actual bug.

#### The Problem We Encountered

- Features page save button was incorrectly enabled on page load
- Existing tests were passing but didn't catch the real-world issue
- The bug was caused by URL parsing inconsistencies and normalization problems

#### The Solution We Implemented

1. **First**: Added comprehensive tests that reproduced the exact bug scenario
2. **Second**: Fixed the actual bug in the code
3. **Third**: Validated that our tests now catch similar issues

#### Why This Order Matters

- **Tests are our safety net**: If tests don't catch bugs, they're not doing their job
- **Prevents regressions**: A test that catches the bug will prevent it from happening again
- **Documents issues**: The test serves as documentation of what went wrong
- **Builds confidence**: We know our testing strategy actually works

#### Example Implementation

```typescript
// Test that catches the URL parsing bug
it("catches the actual FeaturesPanel bug with URL parsing", () => {
  const widget = makeWidget({
    orderUrl: "https://togoorder.com/web?id=1609#!/?utm_source=everybite",
  });

  // Simulate buggy URL parsing
  const baseUrl = widget.orderUrl?.split("?")[0] ?? "";
  const utmTags = widget.orderUrl?.split("?")[1] ?? "";
  const fullUrl = `${baseUrl}${utmTags ? `?${utmTags}` : ""}`;

  act(() => {
    result.current.handleFieldChange({
      orderUrl: fullUrl || null,
    });
  });

  // Test should FAIL when bug is present
  expect(result.current.dirty).toBe(true);
});
```

#### Test Quality Guidelines Established

- **Use realistic data**: Don't use simplified test data that doesn't match real scenarios
- **Test edge cases**: Include complex URLs, nested objects, undefined values, etc.
- **Document the scenario**: Explain what the test is checking and why it's important
- **Make it specific**: Target the exact issue, not just general functionality
- **Keep it maintainable**: Use helper functions and clear test names

#### Impact and Benefits

- **Immediate**: Tests now catch issues before they reach production
- **Long-term**: Prevents regressions and builds confidence in our testing strategy
- **Documentation**: Issues are documented through tests
- **Process**: Established workflow for future bug fixes

## ✅ Final Fixes, API Key Correction, and Proxy/Debug Cleanup (2025-07-21)

- **API Key Issue Resolved:** Discovered a case-sensitive typo in `.env.test` (`VITE_API_KEY`). Updated to match the production key exactly, resolving all API integration test failures.
- **Proxy/Debug Cleanup:** Removed all proxy-related debugging code and the `global-agent` dependency after confirming the root cause was not proxying but an environment variable typo.
- **Best Practice Setup:** Updated `src/setupTests.ts` to load `.env.test` globally for all tests, ensuring environment variables are always available and reducing duplication.
- **Test Suite Restored:** All API smoke tests now pass with the correct environment setup. Remaining test failures are unrelated to API/auth and will be addressed separately.
- **Commit and Documentation:** Staged and committed all relevant changes, including test, hook, and environment updates, and cleaned up all debug/proxy artifacts.
