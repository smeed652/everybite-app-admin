**Overall Progress**: 83% (5/6 phases completed)  
**Sprint**: Sprint 10 - Test Suite Restoration & Quality Assurance  
**Latest Release**: `v1.0.1+249` (2025-07-20)

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1**: Cache Infrastructure Setup ✅
  - Apollo Client configuration
  - Basic cache utilities
  - Service-level caching

- [x] **Phase 2**: Apollo Client Integration ✅
  - Operation-level TTLs
  - Dynamic cache configuration
  - Cache persistence

- [x] **Phase 3**: Cache Management UI ✅
  - Cache configuration interface
  - Cache status display
  - Refresh and clear cache controls
  - Change detection for save button

- [x] **Phase 4**: Lambda GraphQL Analytics & Cache Management ✅
  - Implemented comprehensive Lambda GraphQL analytics queries
  - Created cache management improvements with data visibility
  - Established data processing pattern architecture
  - Deployed and tested Lambda GraphQL queries
  - Created comprehensive testing with real Lambda data
  - Documented architectural patterns for future development

- [x] **Phase 5**: Data Processing Foundation (Completed)
  - Service layer implementation for data processing
  - Frontend integration patterns with Lambda data
  - Dashboard integration and testing fixes
  - Scalable data architecture for growing widget counts
  - Release tagging system with build numbers

- [ ] **Phase 6**: Test Suite Restoration & Quality Assurance (In Progress)
  - Critical architecture fixes for dashboard and SmartMenu tests
  - API integration fixes for Lambda GraphQL and hybrid service tests
  - Test infrastructure improvements and standardization
  - Performance optimization and CI/CD integration

- [ ] **Phase 7**: Advanced Optimization & Enhancement (Future)
  - Performance optimization for large datasets
  - Advanced caching features (scheduled refresh, progress indicators)
  - Comprehensive documentation and standards
  - Chain classification enhancements
  - Production scale optimization

## Current Work

**Phase 6** focuses on test suite restoration and quality assurance after the significant architecture changes introduced in Phase 5. This includes fixing critical test failures, updating tests for the new service layer architecture, and establishing robust testing patterns for future development.

## Key Features Implemented
