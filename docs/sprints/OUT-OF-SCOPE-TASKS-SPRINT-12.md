# Out-of-Scope Tasks - Sprint 12: Business Logic Architecture & Testing Strategy

## Purpose

This file tracks tasks that are outside the current sprint scope but need attention. These will be discussed at the end of each story and can be addressed if they become critical or if time permits. All out-of-scope items will be added to the deferred work backlog for future consideration.

## Sprint Information

- **Sprint**: Sprint 12 - Business Logic Architecture & Testing Strategy
- **Start Date**: 2025-01-15
- **End Date**: 2025-02-05
- **Current Story**: Story 1 - Business Logic Foundation
- **Total Story Points**: 21 SP (7 SP per story)

## Sprint Scope Boundaries

### **What IS In Scope (Sprint 12):**

- **Story 1**: Business Logic Foundation (7 SP) - Directory structure, patterns, types, quarterly metrics enhancement
- **Story 2**: Dashboard Business Logic Extraction (7 SP) - Extract dashboard logic from UI components
- **Story 3**: Testing Strategy Implementation (7 SP) - Testing patterns and contract testing

### **What is NOT In Scope (Out-of-Scope):**

#### **UI/Design Related:**

- [ ] **UI Component Refactoring**: Any changes to UI components beyond importing business logic
- [ ] **Component Testing**: Writing tests for UI components
- [ ] **UI Design Changes**: Any visual or design modifications
- [ ] **Component Architecture**: Changes to component structure or patterns

- [ ] **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance testing

#### **Advanced Features:**

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Any performance improvements beyond basic structure
- [ ] **Advanced Caching**: Complex caching strategies or optimizations
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Complex analytics or reporting features
- [ ] **Advanced Validation**: Complex validation schemas or rules
- [ ] **Advanced Error Handling**: Complex error handling beyond basic patterns

#### **Infrastructure Changes:**

- [ ] **Build System Changes**: Modifications to build configuration
- [ ] **Deployment Changes**: Changes to deployment processes
- [ ] **CI/CD Changes**: Modifications to CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] **Environment Changes**: Changes to environment configuration
- [ ] **Database Changes**: Schema changes or database optimizations

#### **Backend Changes:**

- [ ] **Lambda Backend Modifications**: Changes to Lambda functions beyond data structure alignment
- [ ] **API Changes**: Modifications to API endpoints or GraphQL schema
- [ ] **Database Queries**: Changes to database queries or data processing
- [ ] **Authentication Changes**: Modifications to authentication or authorization

## Story 1 - Business Logic Foundation

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

_No out-of-scope tasks encountered yet_

### Notes:

- Focus on creating the foundation structure only
- Don't implement complex business logic beyond basic patterns
- Don't start on dashboard or testing work
- Keep it simple and focused on the foundation
- Any out-of-scope tasks should be added to deferred work backlog

## Story 2 - Dashboard Business Logic Extraction

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

_Story not started yet - waiting for Story 1 completion_

### Notes:

- Only extract dashboard logic from UI components
- Don't modify UI components beyond importing business logic
- Don't implement new dashboard features
- Don't start on testing strategy work
- Any out-of-scope tasks should be added to deferred work backlog

## Story 3 - Testing Strategy Implementation

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

_Story not started yet - waiting for Stories 1 & 2 completion_

### Notes:

- Only implement testing patterns for business logic
- Don't write tests for UI components
- Don't implement E2E testing
- Don't modify existing tests beyond migration
- Any out-of-scope tasks should be added to deferred work backlog

## Common Out-of-Scope Patterns

### **If You Encounter These, They're Out-of-Scope:**

1. **"While we're here..."** - Any work that's not directly related to business logic architecture
2. **"This would be better if..."** - Improvements that aren't part of the sprint scope
3. **"We should also..."** - Additional features or enhancements
4. **"Let's fix this too..."** - Bug fixes or improvements not related to sprint scope
5. **"This reminds me..."** - Related work that belongs in other sprints

### **How to Handle Out-of-Scope Tasks:**

1. **Document them here** with impact and effort estimate
2. **Don't implement them** unless they become blocking
3. **Add to deferred work backlog** (`docs/stories/future/DEFERRED-WORK-BACKLOG.md`)
4. **Create separate stories** for high-priority items
5. **Reassess scope** only if they become critical blockers

## Sprint Scope Creep Prevention

### **Questions to Ask Before Adding Work:**

1. **Is this directly related to business logic architecture?**
2. **Is this required for Sprint 12 to be complete?**
3. **Can this wait until a future sprint?**
4. **Is this a blocking issue or a nice-to-have?**
5. **Does this fit within the 21 story points allocated?**

### **Red Flags (Stop and Reassess):**

- Work that would take more than 2 days
- Work that involves UI components or design
- Work that requires significant infrastructure changes
- Work that involves backend modifications
- Work that's not documented in the sprint scope
- Work that belongs to other sprints or projects

## Deferred Work Process

### **When Out-of-Scope Tasks Are Encountered:**

1. **Document here** with full details (impact, effort, priority)
2. **Add to deferred work backlog** with proper categorization
3. **Don't implement** unless it becomes a critical blocker
4. **Review at sprint end** to determine if any should be prioritized
5. **Create separate stories** for high-priority items in future sprints
