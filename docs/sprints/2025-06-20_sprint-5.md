# Sprint 5 — SmartMenu Audit & Polish

*Start: 2025-06-20*
*End: 2025-06-27 (1-week sprint)*

## Objectives
1. Audit refactored SmartMenu panels (Features, Marketing, Basic) against production for 100 % functional and visual parity.
2. Close or log any regressions.
3. Raise automated coverage (unit, integration, E2E) for SmartMenu.
4. Complete remaining extraction / cleanup tasks from Sprint 4.
5. Maintain accessibility and performance standards.

## Ranked Task List

### 1 – SmartMenu Audit (skipped)
*(These steps became unnecessary after unifying dirty-state logic; team agreed to defer full audit to a later release)*
- [x] ~~Spin up production widget and local refactor side-by-side~~
- [x] ~~Verify each SettingToggle’s behaviour (enable/disable, diff emission)~~
- [x] ~~Validate Ordering URL builder (base + UTM)~~
- [x] ~~Confirm Build-Your-Own, Nutrients, Allergens flows~~
- [x] ~~Capture screenshots / notes for discrepancies~~
- [x] ~~Log GitHub issues (label `audit`) for each regression~~

### 2 – Regression Test Suite
- [ ] Unit: `SettingToggle` render + state transitions.
- [ ] Integration:
  - SmartMenu detail diff flow
  - Ordering URL logic
  - BYO / Nutrients paths
- [ ] Cypress E2E: user toggles settings and observes widget changes.

### 3 – Apollo Mock Expansion
- [ ] Add `banners` and `menuItems` sub-fields to mocked `Widget` factory.
- [ ] Adjust tests to satisfy new schema shape.

### 4 – Accessibility & UX Review
- [ ] Run `axe-core` against SmartMenu pages.
- [ ] Check keyboard navigation & ARIA (`role="switch"`).
- [ ] Fix WCAG issues that don’t require major redesign.

### 5 – Sprint 4 Carry-overs
- [ ] Extract shared components: `LabeledInput`, `TwoColGrid`, `InlineAction`.
- [ ] Add `CollapsibleSettingToggle` or extend base.
- [ ] Implement `applyIfChanged` util and refactor diff logic.

### 6 – Performance & Bundle Check
- [ ] Investigate >500 kB chunk warnings; evaluate manual chunking / `import()`.

### 7 – Documentation & Report
- [ ] Fill out `docs/audit/sprint5-smartmenu-audit.md` with findings.
- [ ] Summarise outcomes in `docs/audit/sprint5-report.md` for stakeholders.
