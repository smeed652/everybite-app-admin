# Sprint 12 â€“ Business Logic Architecture & Testing Strategy (2025-01-15 â†’ 2025-02-05)

Focus: Implement business logic separation from UI components and establish testing strategy that survives UI refactors.

## Goal / Definition of Done

Business logic architecture is implemented with clear separation of concerns, pure functions for data transformations, and testing strategy that ensures UI refactor safety.
