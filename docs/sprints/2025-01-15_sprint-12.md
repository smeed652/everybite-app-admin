# Sprint 12 â€“ Business Logic Architecture & Testing Strategy (2025-01-15 â†’ 2025-02-05)

Focus: Implement business logic separation from UI components and establish testing strategy that survives UI refactors.

## Goal / Definition of Done

Business logic architecture is implemented with clear separation of concerns, pure functions for data transformations, and testing strategy that ensures UI refactor safety.

## Story 2: Business Logic Architecture & Testing Strategy ðŸ”„

**Status**: In Progress - Building on quarterly metrics debugging work

### Priority Tasks:

1. **Business logic extraction** - Separate business logic from UI components
2. **Pure function implementation** - Create testable business logic functions
3. **Testing strategy implementation** - Establish patterns that survive UI refactors
4. **Integration and documentation** - Complete migration guide and process docs

## Ceremonies

- Planning: Mon 01-15, 1 h
- Daily stand-up: 10 min
- Mid-sprint demo: Fri 01-26 â€“ Phase 1 completed
- Review & retro: Fri 02-02

## Risks / Mitigations

- **Breaking existing functionality** â†’ Incremental migration, comprehensive testing, rollback plan
- **Performance degradation** â†’ Performance testing, optimization, monitoring
- **Team resistance to new patterns** â†’ Clear documentation, examples, gradual adoption
- **Scope creep** â†’ Strict scope definition, regular reviews, change control

---

## Success Metrics
