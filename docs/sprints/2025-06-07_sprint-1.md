## Sprint Goal
Bootstrap the SmartMenu Admin Panel repository and developer workflow.

## Key Objectives
1. Repository initialization (Vite + React + TS scaffold)
2. Continuous Integration skeleton (GitHub Actions)
3. Baseline documentation and contribution guidelines
4. Initial task tracking via GitHub Issues

## Completed Work
- ✅ Created private GitHub repository `everybite-app-admin`
- ✅ Added Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold (`main` branch)
- ✅ Committed initial ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS setup
- ✅ Added shadcn/ui library for component primitives
- ✅ Configured Husky & lint-staged pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Wrote contributing guidelines and updated README
- ✅ Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow: install → lint → test → build
- ✅ Generated Personal Access Token (PAT) and authenticated `gh` CLI
- ✅ Created five high-level GitHub Issues for upcoming sprint tasks with estimates
- ✅ Verified issues on GitHub and shared links with team

## Metrics
| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Repository bootstrapped | 100 % | 100 % |
| Lint errors | 0 | 0 |
| CI passing | 100 % | 100 % |

## Retrospective Notes
- What went well: rapid scaffold, automated tooling set up early, clear task break-down.
- What could improve: earlier stakeholder demo of scaffold, tighter estimate on CI timings.
- Actions for next sprint: focus on feature branches for auth, logging, error boundaries; maintain small PRs.
