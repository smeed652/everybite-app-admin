### **When You're Ready to Pick Up Deferred Work:**

2. **Create New Story** or add to existing story scope

## üéØ Best Practices

### **When to Defer Work:**

- **Scope Creep**: Work that expands beyond original story scope
- **Dependencies**: Work that depends on other stories or external factors
- **Priority**: Work that's lower priority than current story goals
- **Complexity**: Work that would significantly extend story timeline
- **Risk**: Work that introduces significant risk or uncertainty

### **When to Pick Up Deferred Work:**

- **Dependencies Resolved**: Blocking dependencies are now complete
- **Sprint Capacity**: Team has capacity for additional work
- **Business Priority**: Work has become higher priority
- **Risk Mitigation**: Work helps reduce technical debt or risk
- **User Impact**: Work significantly improves user experience

### **Documentation Standards:**

- **Clear Reasoning**: Always explain why work was deferred
- **Dependencies**: List what needs to happen before work can resume
- **Effort Estimates**: Provide rough time estimates for planning
- **Priority Levels**: Use consistent priority terminology
- **Source Tracking**: Always reference the original story
