## Story Information

- **Story**: [STORY-NAME]
- **Sprint**: [SPRINT-NUMBER]
- **Start Date**: [DATE]
- **Current Step**: [STEP-NUMBER]

## Step [X] - [Step Name]

### Out-of-Scope Tasks Encountered:

- [ ] **Task Name**: Brief description of the task
  - **Impact**: What this task affects if not addressed
  - **Effort Estimate**: Rough time estimate (if known)
  - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
  - **Status**: PENDING/IN PROGRESS/COMPLETED/DEFERRED
  - **Notes**: Additional context or considerations

- [ ] **Another Task**: Brief description
  - **Impact**: What this task affects if not addressed
  - **Effort Estimate**: Rough time estimate (if known)
  - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
  - **Status**: PENDING/IN PROGRESS/COMPLETED/DEFERRED
  - **Notes**: Additional context or considerations

### Notes:

- Priority should be reassessed if they become blocking issues
- Consider creating separate stories for high-priority items

## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** to your story directory as `OUT-OF-SCOPE-TASKS-[STORY-NAME].md`
2. **Update the header** with your specific story information
3. **Add tasks as you encounter them** during story development
4. **Update status** as tasks are addressed or deferred
5. **Review at the end of each step** to determine if any tasks need attention
6. **Archive with the story** when the story is completed

## Example Completed Entry

Here's an example of how a completed task might look:

- [x] **Lambda Infrastructure Fix**: Lambda GraphQL endpoint returning 502/500 errors for most queries - **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper error handling in tests to accept 500 errors as infrastructure issues
  - **Evidence**: `lambda-graphql.smoke.test.ts` handles 500 errors gracefully while validating connectivity
  - **Status**: Tests now pass with infrastructure issues documented
